from background to perspectives.
However, the sections are flavored by preterite tense and subjective angling.</p>

<p>For example in <em>background</em> I will also talk about my dive into the world about cloud computing,
how my interest for web development fueled the motivation for my thesis topic
and my work to familiarize with cloud computing.</p></section></aside></div><div id="background" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Background</h2><p>Motivation and cloud introduction</p><aside class="note"><section><p>As mentioned here I will present my own initial motivation for the thesis,
as well as cover the basic introduction to cloud computing.
You have already read the thesis, and should therefore have some
insight into cloud computing.
Nevertheless a oral angling might shed new light on the field.</p></section></aside></section></div><div id="motivation" class="slide"><header><h1>Motivation</h1></header><section><ul class="bullets"><li>Web evangelist</li><li>Google App Engine (GAE)</li></ul></section><aside class="note"><section><p>By now I consider myself a web evangelist, as co-developer of sites such as 
forsvaret.no and contributor to frameworks such as twitter bootstrap.
And Cloud Computing goes hand in hand with web developing.
It is not limited to this area, but its the main approach today.</p>

<p>I have been intereseted in GAE since its release in 2008.
As a Java develper the new PaaS technology was very intriuging,
with the ability to publish a automatically scaling web-based 
java application just by clicking a button.
This was one of the first PaaS solutions, and even used a NoSQL DB solution 
(the term was yet coined).</p></section></aside></div><div id="stage-of-the-art" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>State of the art</h2></section></div><div id="challenges" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Challenges</h2></section></div><div id="requirements" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Requirements</h2></section></div><div id="vision" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Vision</h2></section></div><div id="implementation" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Implementation</h2></section></div><div id="validation" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Validation</h2></section></div><div id="conclusion" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Conclusion</h2></section></div><div id="perspectives" class="slide transitionSlide"><section class="middle"><h2>Perspectives</h2></section></div></div><div id="speaker-note" class="invisible"></div></div><script src="src/prettify/prettify.js" onload="prettyPrint();"></script><script src="js/utils.js"></script></body></html>
