\chapter{Introduction}

Cloud Computing~\cite{Armbrust:EECS-2009-28} is gaining in popularity,
both in the academic world and in software industry.
One of the greatest advantages of Cloud Computing is \emph{on-demand self service},
providing dynamic scalability~(\emph{elasticity}).
As Cloud Computing utilizes \emph{pay-as-you-go} payment solution,
customers are offered fine-grained costs for rented services.
These advantages can be exploited to prevent web-applications
from breaking during peak loads, and supporting an ``unlimited''
amount of end users.
According to Amazon (provider of \myac{AWS}, a major Cloud Computing host):
\emph{``much like plugging in a microwave
in order to power it doesn't require any knowledge of electricity,
one should be able to plug in an application to the cloud in order
to receive the power it needs to run, 
just like a utility''}~\cite{aws:varia10}.
Although the technical challenge when ``plugging'' an application into the cloud
is yet transparent.

Cloud providers stresses the need of technological advantages originating from Cloud Computing.
They emphasize how horizontal and vertical scalability can enhance applications
to become more robust.
The main issue is technological inconsistencies for provisioning between providers,
\eg \myac{AWS} offer \myac{CLI} tools, while Rackspace only offer web-based \myac{API}s.
Although most providers offer APIs these are different as well, 
they are inconsistent in layout, usage and entities.
Intercloud~\cite{intercloud}, or ``multicloud''.
