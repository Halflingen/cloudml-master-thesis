\chapter{Background}

Cloud computing is gaining popularity and more companies are starting 
to explore the possibilities as well as the limitation to the cloud.
The nist definition of cloud computin (draft)~\cite{nist:mell11}
define \emph{Infrastrucutre-as-a-Service}~(IaaS) as
``The capability provided to the consumer is to provision 
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the 
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating 
systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud 
infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and 
possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).``
