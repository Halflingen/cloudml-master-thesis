The envisions and designs of CloudML is implemented as a proof-of-concept project \emph{cloudml-engine}.
The project is split into four different modules~\citefig{cloudml-engine}. 
Each module serves a logical task of CloudML.

\section{Technologies}

Cloudml-engine is written in Scala, a multi-paradigm JVM based programming language.
This language was chosen because JVM is a popular platform, and then especially Java.
Scala is compatible with Java and Java can interact with libraries written in Scala as well.
The reason not to use plain Java was because Scala is an appealing state-of-the-art language that emphasizes 
on functional programming which is leveraged in the implementation.
Scala also has a built in system for Actors model~\cite{actors:haller07} which is utilized in the implementation.
For the lexical representation of CloudML \emph{JavaScript Object Notation}~(JSON) was chosen.
JSON is a web-service friendly, human-readable data interchange format and an alternative to XML.
This format was chosen because of popularity in the cloud community \todo{source}
and its usage area as data transmit format between servers and web applications.
This means cloudml-engine
