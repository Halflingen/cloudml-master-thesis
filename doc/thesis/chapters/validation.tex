\mychapter{validation}{Validation \& Experiments}

To validate how CloudML addresses the requirements from~\citechap{requirements},
a topology of three nodes~(\citefig{threenodes}) is provisioned.
This topology is the same as Alice used for her second scenario in \citesec{meta-model}.
The setup is sufficient to do a full deployment of the \emph{BankManager} application.

\paragraph{Template.}
\input{codes/validation-threenodes}

The implementation uses \myac{JSON} to define templates as a human readable serialization mechanism.
The lexical representation of \citefig{threenodes} can be seen in \citelist{validation-threenodes}. 
There are a total of two templates, three nodes, and one load balancer.
Each node have specific attributes regarding their tasks, similar to Alice's scenario,
but as an addiontal precaution the \texttt{front-end} nodes have increased \myac{RAM}.
All nodes in the first template are bound to the load balancer~(\texttt{loadBalancer})
defined within the template.
This is why there are two templates, since the \texttt{back-end} node should not be bound to the load balancer.
This is by design, as a \texttt{template} is not directly bound to a topology,
and is also why \texttt{build} accept a list of templates.
The whole text represents the \texttt{Template} and consequently 
``\texttt{nodes}'' is a list of \texttt{Node} from the model.
The JSON is textual which makes it \emph{shareable} as files.
Once such a file is created it can be reused (\emph{reproducibility}) 
on any supported provider (\emph{multicloud}).
These benefits match the requirement \citereq{lexical-template}.
