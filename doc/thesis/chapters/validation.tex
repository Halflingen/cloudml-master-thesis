\mychapter{validation}{Validation \& Experiments}

To validate how CloudML addresses the requirements from~\citechap{requirements},
a topology of three nodes is provisioned~(\citefig{threenodes}).
This topology is the same as Alice used for her second scenario in \citesec{meta-model}.
The setup is sufficient to do a full deployment of the \emph{BankManager} application.

The implementation uses \myac{JSON} to define templates as a human readable serialization mechanism.
The lexical representation of \citefig{threenodes} can be seen in \citelist{validation-threenodes}. 
The whole text represents the \texttt{Template} of \citefig{threenodes} and consequently 
``nodes'' is a list of \texttt{Node} from the model.
The JSON is textual which makes it \emph{shareable} as files.
Once such a file is created it can be reused (\emph{reproducibility}) 
on any supported provider (\emph{multicloud}).
These benefits match the requirement \citereq{lexical-template}.

Characteristics of each node are carefully chosen based on each nodes feature area, for instance 
front-end nodes have more computation power, while the back-end node will have more disk.
