\mychapter{perspectives}{Perspectives}

In this chapter the future of CloudML is presented.
It faces two main topics.
The first about short term improvements to the implementation, both in features, enhancements and refactoring.
The second stresses the future of CloudML in terms of long term enhancements,
then not just for the implementation but in core design.

\section{Short term (implementation) perspectives}

\paragraph{Load balancer.}
\input{codes/loadbalancer.tex}

The feature of load balancer is implemented in \emph{cloudml-engine}, but at writing moment~(\date{April 2012}),
is not supported by \emph{jclouds}.
The library, \emph{jclouds}, have interfaces which suggest how to interact to create load balancers,
but full support of creating them is not yet complete.

Core design of introducing a load balancer into CloudML is expressed in \citelist{loadbalancer}.
The idea is to simply let every node within a template be bound to a given load balancer.
As a template is not bound to reflect a topology, but rather be part of one.

These interfaces in \emph{jclouds} to create load balancers are utilized in \emph{cloudml-engine}, 
but not supported.
The main point about implementing this was that when \emph{jclouds} fully support load balancers,
the dependency version can be updated to the latest version.
This would in theory give full support for this new feature.

\paragraph{Authentication.}

The current version of CloudML does not express how \myac{SSH} keys should be defined.
In \emph{cloudml-engine} this is solved to use the default approach by \emph{jclouds} library,
\ie for \myac{AWS} keys are generated as provisioning takes place.

Examples of solutions could be to include credentials in the template file, or the account file.
The authentication method between providers differ, \eg in \myac{AWS} \myac{SSH} keys are assigned to a node,
while in Rackspace a root password is returned for each node.
To implement a common solution \emph{cloudml-engine} could use this password to automatically 
log into each node, inject a given \myac{SSH} key, obscure root password by changing it and log out.

\paragraph{Refactoring of actor logic.}

Logic for provisioning is currently located in \texttt{cloud-connector} module.
The reason for this is because the implementation built so it can differ between which library is used for provisioning, 
which currently is \emph{jclouds}.

What can be done as an improved alternative is to move the provisioning logic out of \texttt{cloud-connector} 
module and into the actor classes~(\texttt{RuntimeInstance}).
The modularity of not being bound to a specific library is still important, and this must be abstracted away.
In the end the \texttt{repository} module would become increasingly more complex in term of pure construction.
The advantage of this would become clear as the complexity of the bridge between \emph{cloudml-engine}
and providers increases, \eg if features such as live managing should be introduced.

\section{Long term research}

\paragraph{Full deployment.}

CloudML as presented in this thesis is designed and implemented to provision nodes over a multi-cloud environment.
This idea can in some simplified version be said to only create instances on a set of supported providers.
The truth is that CloudML fulfills more than just that, and even to conquer such task by itself is not a small feat.

Although in reality end users are looking for something more than just creating instances in the cloud,
they eventually want to move their application to the cloud environment.
And to handle this they want a library which does as much of this as possible,
from pressing a button to having an application up and running on the cloud.

What CloudML should struggle to achieve in future versions is to provide support for \emph{full deployments}.
To accomplish this there are several topics to address, such as
\begin{ii}
  \iitem third party software,
  \iitem operating system,
  \iitem package managers,
  \iitem authentication,
  \iitem communication between nodes.
\end{ii}
Additional software must be considered to assist in many of these topics,
\eg Puppet to handle third party software and installations.

\paragraph{Cloud management.}

After provisioning, or even deployment, is complete the users are left for them selves to
manage any instances related to a provisioning.
Such management could be to 
\begin{ii}
  \iitem terminate nodes, 
  \iitem stop nodes, 
  \iitem restart nodes,
  \iitem apply vertical scaling or
  \iitem assign load balancer.
\end{ii}
The web-based consoles offered by providers are of a high standard,
\eg the \myac{AWS} console displayed in~\citefig{validation-consoles}.
Because of this quality in consoles, 
there is not a greater problem for users to do management themselves.
Although such functionality could be built into CloudML,
not just as an alternative, 
but as an improvement for users already relying on CloudML.
The implementation, \emph{cloudml-engine}, possesses the ability to terminate nodes
through a method call, provided a nodes \emph{ID}. 
This functionality have been mainly used for testing purposes, 
but is fully operational and available.
Although just providing the means of functionalities needed to fulfill management is not
sufficient for CloudML, as a model-driven approach there must be a
refined link between templates, provisioning and management.
This is the main perspective of management in CloudML,
to find solutions to tackle the management problem through researching in the model-based realm.
