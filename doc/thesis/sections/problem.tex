\section{Contribution \#1, Towards CloudML (20)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Link challenges to properties (chap 3) \\
      1 challenge = 1 paragraph
  \item Outline the problem
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Information dependency at runtime
      \item Technical competence/level expectations
      \item Reproducibility
      \item Robustness
      \item Complexity
      \item Shareable
    \end{itemize}
  \item State how the problem is not solved by any suggestions in my 'state-of-art' section
  \item Why is it important to solve the problems
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud domain is state of the art
      \item model driven approach with benefits (no special tooling)
      \item Easier for businesses (especially SMBs) to reach out to Cloud
      \item Easier for larger more time-constraint businesses to try out the cloud
      \item Opening the eyes of big providers for a larger cross-cloud language
    \end{itemize}
  \item Introduce \emph{BankManager}, case study
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What it can do
    \item Technologies used
    \item Why it is relevant
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Enterpriseish setup
        \item Copy from CloudMDE chap 2
