\section{Introduction (30)}

\subsection{Introduction}
\note{Short and sharps}

\todo{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Main introduction
    \item Write lastly
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Background}
\note{
  Explain some of the topics in my thesis. \\
  Here it is possible to introduce case study (BankManager) to ease writing
}

\todo {
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find a new title, 'Background' is too plain
    \item What is cloud computing and IaaS
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Summarize nist definition of cloud
        \item Short description of AWS
        \item Short description of Rackspace
      \end{itemize}
    \item What is model-based engineering and benefits. \\
        Core concepts
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{State of the Art in Provisioning}
- 

\note{
Evaluation of existing solutions \\
What have others done for multicloud provisioning \\
Even more examples in mOSAIC articles
}

\todo{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Identify \emph{properties} (problems in reality)
    \item Find more sources
    \item Model driven
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Amazon CloudFormation
        \item CA Applogic
      \end{itemize}
    \item APIs
      \begin{itemize}
        \item libcloud
        \item jclouds
        \item Deltacloud
      \end{itemize}
    \item Deployments
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Amazon Beanstalk
        \item simplifying-solution-deployment-on-a-cloud-through-composite-appliances
        \item architecture-for-virtual-solution-composition-and-deployment
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Problem definition with examples}
\todo{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Outline the problem \\
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Information dependency at runtime
        \item Technical competence/level expectations
        \item Reproducibility
        \item Robustness
        \item Complexity
        \item Shareable
      \end{itemize}
    \item Why is it important to solve the problems
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Cloud domain is state of the art
        \item model driven approach with benefits (no special tooling)
        \item Easier for businesses (especially SMBs) to reach out to Cloud
        \item Easier for larger more time-constraint businesses to try out the cloud
        \item Opening the eyes of big providers for a larger cross-cloud language
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Requirements to solution (with table)}
\todo {
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Copy in my existing table from the essay \\
      \question{Requirements = challenge = problem?}
  \end{itemize}
}
