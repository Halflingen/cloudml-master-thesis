\section{Introduction}

Short about my problem, why it's important and whats to be found in the thesis 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Summarize the \textbf{problem} \\
      Challenges from CloudMDE
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Information dependency at runtime
      \item Technical competence/level expectations
      \item Reproducibility
      \item Robustness
      \item Complexity
      \item Shareable
    \end{itemize}
  \item Short description of terms used
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud (computing)
      \item Model-driven engineering
      \item Provider (cloud provider)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Why is it an important problem \\
      Ranting\ldots
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud domain is state of the art
      \item model driven approach with benefits (no special tooling)
      \item Easier for businesses (especially SMBs) to reach out to Cloud
      \item Easier for larger more time-constraint businesses to try out the cloud
      \item Opening the eyes of big providers for a larger cross-cloud language
    \end{itemize}
  \item Shortly mention CloudML \\
      Summary from chap 3 in CloudMDE
  \item Shortly mention cloudml-engine \\
      Copy/paste implementation paragraph from CloudMDE
  \item Summarize chapters of thesis
\end{itemize}
