#[CloudML](http://eirikb.github.com/cloudml-master-thesis/thesis.pdf)

This is my master thesis, _CloudML - A DSL for model-based realization of applications in the cloud_.  
I have decided to publish the __LaTeX__ sources, as others might find them helpful.  
They include examples of different scenarios, such as adding figures and source code.  

## Disclaimer

I have tried to follow some best practices, but not everything is perfect, and as time goes by it might become obsolete and outdated.  
If this repository should end up as an example to other, it would be wise to keep it in a good shape.
This is nothing I can promise, so if anyone want to make updates feel free to make issues and/or with pull requests.  

Most of this repository was removed to not violate copyright and owner issues, I have tried to put it back together without dependencies so it will still build.
